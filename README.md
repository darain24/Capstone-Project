This is my 1st semester Capstone project for the S&W course. It is developed using HTML and CSS.<br>
The HTML code is written in a structurally organised manner which is easy to understand.<br>
It has hover effects, basic animations and an aesthetic look. The images too have hover effect with smooth transitions.<br>
It uses different font styles, font colors. The text have text-align property to give the webpage a symmetric look.<br>
The webpage is responsive for different devices. It has been made possible using relative units like (%, rem, em).<br>
