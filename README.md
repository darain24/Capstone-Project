This is my 1st semester Capstone project for the S&W course. It is developed using HTML and CSS.
It has hover effects, basic animations and an aesthetic look. The images too have hover effect with smooth transitions.
It uses different font styles, font colors. The text have text-align property to give the webpage a symmetric look.
The webpage is responsive for different devices. It has been made possible using relative units like (%, rem, em).
